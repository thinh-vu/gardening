# 📒 Highlights

> “From very early on in Amazon's life, we knew we wanted to create a culture of builders—people who are curious, explorers…. Even when they're experts, they are ‘fresh’ with a beginner's mind…. A builder's mentality helps us approach big, hard-to-solve opportunities with a humble conviction that success can come through iter- ation: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again. They know the path to success is anything but straight.”— Amazon 2015 Annual Report
