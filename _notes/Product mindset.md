# Highlights 📒

Mindsets aren’t just any beliefs. They are beliefs that orient our reactions and tendencies. They serve a number of cognitive functions. They let us frame situations: they direct our attention to the most important cues so that we’re not overwhelmed with information. They suggest sensible goals so that we know what we should be trying to achieve. They prime us with reasonable courses of action so that we don’t have to puzzle out what to do. When our mindsets become habitual, they define who we are and who we can become. 14 —GARY KLEIN, PHD - (Page 36).

**The Product Must Be Self-Funding:** A successful product generates revenue and support that fuels the business and justifies further investment. | **Minimize Time to Value**: Value exists in the hands of customers. Put the smallest solution to their biggest problems in their hands, monetize it, and learn what to do next. 
 The Product Must Be Chosen: Success requires that someone choose your product, use it, share it, and keep using it as new competitors enter the market and new customer problems emerge. | Solve for Need: Being chosen means understanding the customer and anticipating and meeting their needs today and tomorrow. 
 The Product Is Never Done: Customer needs change, markets and regulations change, and new competitors appear all the time. Successful products stay ahead of the change. | Excel at Change: Know when to change course, hold fast, let go, and have the tools to do it smoothly.

MEASURING SUCCESS WITH THE PRODUCT MINDSET
Metrics should show top-line ==revenue growth, improved retention, and increased market share==. If the product creates value for the customer, the company can reach their goals too. 

When building for outcomes, a company can also measure success by examining ==adoption, engagement, and referrals==. (Page 43). 

SLICE APPROACH
Good software engineers solve for today with tomorrow in mind. 

A team that’s focused on minimizing time to value accepts that it won’t know everything and just needs to solve part of the problem. 
Slices cut across the blocks of functionality and allow a customer to complete some or all of a workflow. A slice can be released faster and allows the team to incorporate feedback before going too far down the product development path. (Page 61). 

BALANCE PREDICTABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY
When trust is low, teams spend more time planning instead of building, and there are disagreements about how to prioritize work. (Page 62).
