ðŸš€ Exciting news! My personal blog achieved a 99% performance score, 88% accessibility score, and 100% on SEO and Best Practices. Of course, it passed the Core Web Vital Assessment. Here are some of the optimizations I made:

-   Upgraded cloud hosting tier for faster memory and I/O speed
-   Implement a SEO friendly WordPress theme
-   Removed unnecessary plugins and JavaScript code
-   Bulk compressed images and leverage the modern image format to improve loading speed
-   Enabled lazy load and caching
-   Turned on AMP for mobile devices
-   Launched Thinh Vu Learning as a separated site while focus on e-learning experience while tweaking the main blog.

ðŸ‘‰ These optimizations can improve your website's page speed and user experience. The point is, you don't need a lot of technical background to implement them. Invest time and effort in improving page experiences that deliver best experiences to your audience that matter. #pagespeed #SEO #websiteoptimization
